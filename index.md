Providing a link between Ireland and Stanford - on campus and further afield.  Say hi if youâ€™re in the Bay!


## Welcome to the Stanford Irish Association website

The Stanford Irish Association became an official organisation at Stanford University in January 2014. The purpose of the association is to ease the transition for new Irish students at Stanford, to provide an official platform for Irish people at Stanford to communicate with the wider community, and to provide a forum for those with Irish heritage or an interest in Irish culture to come together. 

You can join our mailing list [here](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/irish-association) or email Rachael on rlhealy@stanford.edu.  And don't forget to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/irishstanford).
